    <p class="description"> Develop a storyboard and visual style for a simple task. This project focuses on the planning process for creating motion and how to take something simple and make it more interesting through the potential of motion. </p>

    <h4 id="exercise-2-flip-book">Exercise 2: Flip Book</h4>

<p>A flip book is more or less a physical gif. Images are placed in a sequence that allows a user to flip through them and create motion from still frames. A flip book is also like a stacked storyboard. Instead of the frames being shown in side by side sequence they are stacked on top of each other. If we took apart a finished flip book we would have a pretty good storyboard.</p>

<p>On the first page of the flip book draw a circle. On the last page of the flip book draw another circle. The circles could be the same size and in the same place or different sizes in different places. Now create a narrative between that connects those two circles by drawing on the pages in between.</p>

<p>Once you are done, take a horizontal video of the flip book (it doesnâ€™t have to be perfect, do the best you can) and upload it to Vimeo. Once it is on Vimeo add it to the class group and submit a link to the video for the Exercise 2 assignment on Blackboard.</p>

    <h4 id="exercise-1-dot-gif">Exercise 1: dot gif</h4>

<p>A simple way to start thinking about motion is through a gif, a short animated image that is controlled through individual frames. The gif should tell a (very short) story that is unique to you.  Make a 15 to 30 frame, greater than 1 second, looping gif that tells that story.</p>
